# WARNING-GAS-NEBULA-INFECTIOUS-DISEASE-ALERT
Gas nebulas are giant Pycnogonida meltdowns in space. As planets are fish we are in danger. Advanced species create nebulas when fighting off giant pycnogonida. Purple is physalia physalis and orange is shell meltdown.

## Hazardous nebula

The great flood is the nebulas which infected each species' origin galaxy. Flood as in Halo for Xbox. Earth is the arc that Noah built. Noah was a construction company which laid dirt (firmament) on planets (fish) for human life. Each species is mixed on Earth as a method of survival. Sin is a viral infection. Demyleation makes infected persons behave ill and creates dangerous mindsets. A species born with sin is a species born into infection. We are going ro have to push back the nebulas with magnets to survive or we will all surely die.


### Orion Nebula (Romulan Flood)

The Orion Nebula was formed from a giant Pycnogonida virus which melted down below the Romulan planets.

### Helix Nebula (Aquarian Flood)

The helix nebula is close to Earth. Located in the aquarius, the helix nebula is only 632 light years away from Earth. Aquarians were wiped out by the Helix Nebula.

### The Ring Nebula (Cat Flood)

The ring nebula is expanding at 20-30km/s below the Lyran constellation.
Earth, formerly known as Oceania traveled to the Milky Way galaxy to avoid the Ring Nebula.

### Strottner-Drechsler-Sainty (Tauran Flood)

The nebula near the Andromeda galaxy started the Star Wars between Romulans and Andromedans when Romulans shot weapons heavily at the nebula so near Andromedan planets. When it was shot, the blatter bursted and the nebula is sinking.

### The Seagull Nebula (K9 Flood)

The Seagul nebula is located between Sirius' two largest habitations.

### Gamma Cygni Nebula (Avian Flood)

The Gamma Cygni Nebula destroyed the Avian galaxy.

### Altair (Avian flood)

A nebula was photographed near Altair by E. E. Bernard in the constellation Aquila.

### Owl Nebula (Bear flood)

The owl nebula destroyed the galaxy of the bear species.
